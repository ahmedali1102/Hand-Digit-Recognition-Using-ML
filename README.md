Here's a short README for the "Hand Digit Recognition Using ML" project based on the provided Jupyter notebook:

Hand Digit Recognition Using Machine Learning
# Overview
This project focuses on recognizing handwritten digits using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this project consists of images of digits (0-9), and the goal is to build a model that accurately classifies each image into the correct digit class.

# Project Structure
Dataset: The dataset used for this project is the MNIST dataset, a standard benchmark in the field of machine learning for image classification tasks.

Notebook: The Jupyter notebook 4. Hand Digit Recognition Using ML.ipynb contains all the code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

# Key Steps
Data Preprocessing: The raw images are preprocessed to ensure they are in a suitable format for model training,

# Model Selection: Machine learning model which is explored

Logistic Regression

# Model Training: The selected models are trained on the training dataset.

Evaluation: The models are evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The best-performing model is identified based on these metrics.

Visualization: Confusion matrices and accuracy plots are generated to visualize the performance of the models.

# Requirements
To run this project, you need the following libraries:

Python 3.x
NumPy
Pandas
scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Seaborn
You can install the required packages using:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn  matplotlib seaborn
Usage
To run the project, open the Jupyter notebook and execute the cells sequentially. The notebook is designed to be self-explanatory, with comments and markdown cells guiding you through each step.

# Results
The notebook demonstrates that machine learning models in recognizing handwritten digits, achieving a high accuracy on the MNIST dataset.

# Conclusion
This project showcases the application of various machine learning techniques in solving a classic image classification problem.
